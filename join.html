                                    <p>Do you want to be a major driving force in the development of a new, promising mode of transportation? As one of the two team captains for KTH Hyperloop, this is the perfect opportunity to do so. 

                                    <br><br>During the scope of the autumn, you will work together with your predecessor, succesively learning about the project, the technology and all of the duties associated with your position. When overtaking the position, you will also collaborate closely with the other Team Captain, whose share of the responsibilities will focus less on the technical aspects of the project. The duties for the Team Captain positions are as follows, and will be split between the two Team Captains:

                                    <br><br>The team captains’ functions exist to both ensure progress and goal completion of the project by being responsible of the project plan and the leadership of the Lead Team of KTH Hyperloop. This includes everything from initial planning to Gantt chart follow up and continuously taking progression updates from sub teams and the insurance of timely decision-making.

                                    <br><br>They are also main responsible for structuring the upcoming stages of the project. This includes ensuring the workflow of the different sub teams is proceeding as planned and having the final decision regarding changes in the general Gantt chart. Excluding the planning of the present project iteration, the team captains will, after discussions with mainly the lead engineer, also decide which changes are ought to be implemented in the next project iteration.

                                    <br><br>Importantly, the team captains have to work towards each member of the team having a common goal. The Team Captains are also responsible for the general wellbeing of the team, working to make the project as developing and fun for the members as possible. This includes motivating the team throughout the duration of the project, making sure that activities such as team-building and after-work events happen on a regular basis and that the general team spirit is high.

                                    <br><br>The organization of recruitment periods is also part of the team captains’ responsibilities. Mainly, this refers to preparing application and interview forms on the online platform Podio, creating an interview booking system which includes the contacting of all candidates, from interview to acceptance or rejection, and make sure that the marketing function is informed about marketing requirements on time for the recruitment.

                                    <br><br>Keeping and developing the contact with the team supervisors is also the responsibility of the team captains. This is maintained in order to ensure that the supervisors are as involved as possible and the team receives technical support when needed. Furthermore, the team captains make sure that the ITRL lab is used optimally, meaning that the inventory and the rooms are in order, but also that all relevant information regarding the building is received and forwarded to the team members.

                                    <br><br>When new competitions and larger events are announced, it is the team captains responsibility to keep contact with the hosts, handle the general administration and inform the team on rules and updates. As implied by the former stated responsibilities, the team captains make the final decision on how the long-term workflow towards the competition should be organized, not to mention whether the team should apply for a competition.

                                    <br><br>Finally, the team captains propose and oversee the budget, while keeping track of the cash flows connected to it.</p>

                                    <p>The technical coordination incorporates the overview of all technical sub teams, having a good understanding of the work that is being conducted in each sub team is important to make sure the project progresses as planned. This includes regularly attending their subteam meetings, typically two subteam meetings er week. Moreover, for initial advice on technical questions, the Sales &amp; Purchasing as well as Marketing team reach out to the lead engineer. Technical conflict resolution includes handling of conflicts that can occur between sub teams, there could be one design change in one team that has a bad effect on another. To find these conflicts and handle them will require a good overview of the project.Long term concept mapping incorporates the mapping of technical development for the pod from a long-term perspective. This includes radical change of sub system and adding or removing sub-system, Concept realization and optimisation.Sprint overview is the responsibility to find delays in the workflow of each sub team. The goal is to guide the sub-teams if they get stuck on specific tasks for too long and to promote a good workflow in the &nbsp;KTH Hyperloop team.</p>

                                            <p>Are you interested in coordinating a group of engineering students into creating and testing a uniquely designed propulsion system? Do you want to become part of the next generation of transportation, whilst getting to know and collaborate with other like-minded students? Does the thought of breaking new ground in the area of electric motors and magnetic levitation excite you?</p>
                                            <p>If yes, now is your chance to make this a reality! KTH Hyperloop is currently recruiting a new lead for the Propulsion and Magnetics sub team, who will ensure that the motor, inverter and battery sytem of what will be the first hyperloop pod prototype in Sweden is finalised, manufactured, tested and incorporated into the pod.</p>
                                            <p>As a sub team lead, you will be responsible for setting up a plan that will result in the finalisation of both the propulsion and levitation system, as well as continuously keeping track of all progress and distributing tasks among you and the other sub team members. Ensuring thorough communication within the sub team as well as with the other sub teams and the team captains is also of high priority. Finally, as many components in the propulsion system are finalised or soon to be finalised, an increasing amount of the workload will be put into planning and executing the manufacturing and testing of the propulsion and magnetics sub systems.</p>
                                            <p>Currently we are focusing on two path in the propulsion and magnetischere team. The first path is to get a working motor system with a rotary motor, which works safely and reliably and additionally meets all safety requirements. For this system most of the components are already there and they have to be set up and tested before using them in the full pod. The second path is the development of a fully new motor. Currently our design is a linear induction motor which is a finished design which has to be manufactured and tested. To be tested additional components like inverters and a power source is needed.&nbsp;</p>

Become part of the team and get a once in a life time opportunity work on the fastest, most talked about mode of modern transportation. You will get&nbsp;the opportunity to work and innovate on challenging topics like designing a motor, the power systems&nbsp;of the pod and also integrate the propulsion system with our pod.</p>
                                        <p>During this period, you get to work with a multidisciplinary team of motivated students. You get the opportunity to apply the knowledge you gained during your studies or discover something completely new. You get the feel of how it is to work in a challenging project environment. During the foreseeable future, we require students in two different applications:</p>
                                        <p><strong><u>R&amp;D:&nbsp;</u></strong>For students with knowledge in electric motors, we have designed a Linear Induction Motor and now it is time to optimise these design to make it reality or design an entirely new propulsion system. If the results of the design are promising enough, it will be basis for the motor design in one of our pod iterations and the results can be published in a report.&nbsp;The knowledge derived from the publication will also act as a basis for future reserach on linear propulsion.&nbsp;COMSOL as well as MatLab and Simulink will be frequently used during this work, hence why experience in these softwares is meritorious.</p>
                                        <p><strong><u>Pod&nbsp;</u><u>integration, assembly and testing:</u></strong>&nbsp;In the meantime, a simpler propulsion system will be used for our first manufactured pod. For this system to be verified, we need students with a genuine interest in powertrain systems to test the chosen propulsion system, as&nbsp;well as optimise how it will be utilised and integrated in the pod for maximum speed. This role will include more practical work, but also a fair share of analysis. However, it is not as theoretically dense, and as long as you are prepared to learn the ropes by devoting a lot of your time and energy to the project, you are welcome to apply.</p>
                                        <p>Please mention which of the&nbsp;positions you prefer in the application.</p>

                                        <p>As a fully functioning hyperloop system comes closer to reality, it is increasingly important to consider how this innovation would merge into the real world. Therefore, we are looking for students to join our Concept &amp; Scalability subteam with the aim of showcasing a concept for the&nbsp;swedish hyperloop network.</p>
                                        <p>The following roles are open for application:</p>
                                        <p><strong><u>City planning:</u></strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong>Do you have knowledge in urban&nbsp;development as well as urban and community planning in general? In that case, this is your chance to bring your vision of how hyperloop should be incorporated in the Swedish cities to life. You will analyse where a potential hyperloop station could be built in Stockholm, and analyse the societal consequences of this.</p>
                                        <p><strong><u>Cost/benefit analysis:</u></strong>&nbsp;For students who are interested in putting your economics skills to practice, this is the perfect role. We need people who are willing to set up an economic analysis of how profitable a possible hyperloop network in Sweden would be, both for the entrepreneurs and society at large.</p>
                                        <p><strong><u>Environmental systems analysis:</u></strong><span>&nbsp;</span>One of the main advantages of the hyperloop technology is its potentially low environmental footprint, compared to other means of transportation. However, this potential needs to be scrutinised, in order to see which positive and negative impacts&nbsp;a swedish hyperloop system would have on the planet. We are looking for students to do a thorough environmental analysis on this concept. If you have knowledge and are interested in LCA, Environmental Impact Assessment or any other similar tools, this is the role for you.</p>
                                        <p><strong><u>Architecture:</u></strong>&nbsp;How will the hyperloop tracks and stations of Sweden look like? Should they be underground or on land, with a feeling of futurism or familiarity? To&nbsp;what extent should the focus lie on aesthetics and functionality respectively? As an architect in this sub-team you will adress these and&nbsp;similar questions regarding the architecture of the infrastructure revolving hyperloop in Sweden. The end product will consist of the interior and exterior design of a hyperloop station, as well as the design of the tubes going to and from the station. With the expertise of&nbsp;our&nbsp;technical members and&nbsp;the knowledge of&nbsp;the other members of this subteam, you will be responsible of designing and visualising this infrastructure.</p>
                                        <p><strong><u>Interior design:</u></strong><span>&nbsp;</span>A&nbsp;vehicle is nothing without its travellers. In turn, they require a well thought out passenger experience, from the moment they&nbsp;enter&nbsp;the hyperloop pod to when they reach their final destination. The members in this position will decide exactly how this experience should turn out. For this role, you should be comfortable in CAD modelling and product development, from the first idea to the final concept.</p>
                                        <p><strong><u>Material&nbsp;engineer:</u></strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
                                        <p><strong><u>Geologists:</u></strong><span>&nbsp;</span>As with any other tranportation system, it is no easy task to determine how to connect to destinations in the most efficient way possible. A compromise needs to be made between the straightest possible route and the easiest track construction. Furthermore, the foundation is essential to consider when choosing where to place the hyperloop stations. For this analysis to be thorough enough, we need students with knowledge in (preferably applied) geology. If you are up to the task, you will become an important asset to make our concept even more solid.</p>

                                        Up until now, our team has focused almost entirely on the technical design of the hyperloop pod, from the suspension and brakes to the energy storage and propulsion. Although we will continue making progress on this, it is time to broaden the perspective. As a fully functioning hyperloop system comes closer to reality, it is increasingly important to consider how this innovation would merge into the real world. Therefore, we are starting a brand new subteam, with the aim of finalising a concept for the swedish hyperloop network.
                                        <br><br>
                                        To kick-start the new subteam, the following roles are open for application:
                                        <br><br>
                                        <b>City planning:</b><br> Do you have knowledge in urban development as well as urban and community planning in general? In that case, this is your chance to bring your vision of how hyperloop should be incorporated in the Swedish cities to life. You will analyse where a potential hyperloop station could be built in Stockholm, and analyse the societal consequences of this.
                                        <br><br>
                                        <b>Cost/benefit analysis:</b><br> For students who are interested in putting your economics skills to practice, this is the perfect role for you. We need people who are willing to set up an economic analysis of how profitable a possible hyperloop network in Sweden would be, both for the entrepreneurs and society at large.
                                        <br><br>
                                        <b>Environmental systems analysis:</b><br> One of the main advantages of the hyperloop technology is its potentially low environmental footprint, compared to other means of transportation. However, this potential needs to be scrutinised, in order to see which positive and negative impacts a swedish hyperloop system would have on the planet. We are looking for students to do a thorough environmental analysis on this concept. If you have knowledge and are interested in LCA, Environmental Impact Assessment or any other similar tools, this is the role for you.
                                        <br><br>
                                        <b>Architects:</b><br> How will the hyperloop tracks and stations of Sweden look like? Should they be underground or on land, with a feeling of futurism or familiarity? To what extent should the focus lie on aesthetics and functionality respectively? As an architect in this sub-team you will adress these and similar questions regarding the architecture of the infrastructure revolving hyperloop in Sweden. The end product will consist of the interior and exterior design of a hyperloop station, as well as the design of the tubes going to and from the station. With the expertise of our technical members and the knowledge of the other members of this subteam, you will be responsible of visualising this infrastructure...
                                        <br><br>
                                        <b>Interior design:</b><br> A vehicle is nothing without its travellers. In turn, they require a well thought out passenger experience, from the moment they enter the hyperloop pod to when they reach their final destination. The members in this position will decide exactly how this experience should turn out. For this role, you should be comfortable in CAD modelling and product development, from the first idea to the final concept.
                                        <br><br>
                                        <b>Material engineer:</b><br> 
                                        <br><br>
                                        <b>Geologists:</b><br> As with any other tranportation system, it is no easy task to determine how to connect to destinations in the most efficient way possible. A compromise needs to be made between the straightest possible route and the easiest track construction. Furthermore, the foundation is essential to consider when choosing where to place the hyperloop stations. For this analysis to be thorough enough, we need students with knowledge in (preferably applied) geology. If you are up to the task, you will become an important asset to make our concept even more solid.
                                        <br><br>
                                        Let us know in the application form which of the positions you would like to apply for.
